                    <p>This was the first MCU movie directed by the Russo Brothers who would go on to direct Civil War,
                        Infinity War and Endgame. It was one of the first MCU films that broke from the traditional
                        superhero film mould and often felt like more of a political thriller with themes of espionage.
                        It dealt with the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D., a secret US government espionage and
                        counter-terrorism division had been secretly infiltrated by the terrorist group Hydra for
                        decades.</p>

                    <img src="img/comic/Phase 2/Winter Soldier/wintersoldier.png"
                        alt="Winter Soldier comic/movie comparison">

                    <p>Much of the story was heavily influenced by Ed Brubaker’s Captain America volume 5 which
                        introduced the Winter Soldier character who is revealed to be Captain America’s best friend
                        Bucky who was thought to have died in the first movie during World War 2, but was in fact found
                        by Hydra and brainwashed into working as an assassin for decades while being cryogenically
                        frozen in between. This is one of the most accurate versions of a comic character in the entire
                        series of movies with many scenes feeling like straight recreations of the comic panels.</p>

                    <p>The same can be said for the Falcon who is also introduced and goes on to join the Avengers in
                        future movies, with the inspiration for his costume design taken from the Ultimates comics.</p>

                    <p>Guardians was probably the first Marvel movie where there was a potential risk of it bombing at
                        the box office. At the time of its announcement, the characters in question were quite niche and
                        didn't even have their own ongoing comic series. It showed Marvel were willing to take risks and
                        break from the traditional movies they had shot so far.</p>

                    <img src="img/comic/Phase 2/GotG/gotg2.jpg" alt="Guardians of the Galaxy team shot">

                    <p>It was losely based on the 2008 comic run by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning, with the team
                        consisting of characters from that although Star-Lord's movie personality differs a lot and this
                        in turn ended up influencing the most recent incarnation of him in the relaunched series.</p>

                    <p>Despite the title, it has nothing to do with the comic event of the same name. It deals with the
                        creation of an artificial intellence by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner for a defence network which
                        ends up becoming sentient and going rogue becuase it believes to save the planet it has to
                        destroy all humanity.</p>

                    <img src="img/comic/Phase 2/Age of Ultron/ultron.jpg" alt="Ultron">

                    <p>His origin was different than the comic version where Hank Pym, who would later appear in
                        Ant-Man, was Ultron's original creator. An Ant-Man movie directed by Edgar Wright was planned in
                        2006 well before the MCU concept started but, due to continuiys delays and scheduling conflicts,
                        it wasn't released until 2015 with a new director.</p>

                    <p>Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, two classic Avengers from the series' very first run in the 60s,
                        were
                        introduced much like they were back then as villains initially who later changed sides and
                        joined the
                        team. However, unlike the comics, their backstory had to be changed from being mutants and
                        children of Magneto (since Marvel didn't have the rights to mutants or X-Men) to being given
                        powers from an Infinity Stone from HYDRA.</p>
